# Linear-Regressions
A collection of projects and assignments from the STAT 425 Intro to Linear Regressions course at the University of Nevada Reno.

HMWK 4 - Correlation
  This homework focused on finding the correlation between different aspects of the data set and interpretting how those correlation coefficients can be rationalized and turned into applicapble conclusions.

HMWK 5 - SLR 1
  This homework focused on plotting data from a data set finding the relationship between shoe size and foot length. The correlation between and normality of the data is found primarily through residuals and comparing a linear regression fitted model to the actual scatter plot graph.
